## Feedback
I prefer to receive feedback: (face to face or in writing or other)
If you are going to correct me: (do it privately or do it in front of the class or other)
If you are going to tell me I'm doing something wrong, phrase it this way:
If you want to praise me: (do it privately or do it in front of the class or other)
It is important to me that feedback is: (timely, includes specific examples, is constructive...etc)
